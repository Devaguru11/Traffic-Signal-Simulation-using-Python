# Traffic-Signal-Simulation-using-Python
This project is a traffic signal simulator built with Python and Pygame, designed to demonstrate how vehicles move and interact with traffic lights at a road intersection.

🔑 Features

Traffic Signal System – Signals switch between red, yellow, and green automatically in cycles.

Vehicle Simulation – Cars, bikes, buses, and trucks are generated randomly with directions (left, right, up, down).

Signal Control – Vehicles stop at red lights and move when signals turn green.

Turning Logic – Some vehicles are assigned turns to simulate realistic traffic movement.

Continuous Flow – Vehicles are continuously spawned to mimic real-world conditions.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (core programming)

Pygame (for graphics and simulation)

Random & Threading (for vehicle generation and signal timing)

🎯 Purpose

The project models a realistic traffic junction, useful for:

Understanding signal-controlled traffic flow

Studying vehicle congestion and wait times

Serving as a base project for smart traffic management research

📂 How it Works

Four signals are created with timers (green, yellow, red).

Vehicles are generated randomly with a type, direction, and speed.

Signals update in cycles, controlling when vehicles move or stop.

Pygame updates the display continuously to show signals and vehicle movement.

🚀 Future Enhancements

AI/ML-based dynamic signal control based on traffic density.

Real-world data integration for smart city simulations.

Adding pedestrian crossings and emergency vehicle priority.
